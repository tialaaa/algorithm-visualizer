# Pathfinding Maze: Visualizing Search Algorithms

### Abstract
Use the Pathfinding Maze to compare two common search algorithms, Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search, through an endless set of randomly generated mazes. The maze is your graph/tree and the algorithms guide you from the designated start node to the end node.

### Deployed App
[Pathfinding Maze](https://tialaaa.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)

### Context
A mini solo project to learn and implement fundamental search algorithms, and provide a visual representation to convey their differences.

### Technologies Used
- React + Vite + JavaScript

### Installation Instructions
- Using the terminal, clone this to your local machine.
- `cd` into new **algorithm-visualizer** directory.
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to launch the project locally. Open the local host in a web browser.
